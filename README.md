• Fig_1_3_S2.R: Generates Figure 1, Figure 3, and Figure S2.
• Fig_2.R: This script produces Figure 2. 
• Fig_4_5.R: Generates Figures 4 and Figure 5. 
• Fig_6.R: Generates Figure 6. 
• Fig_S1.R: Produce Figure S1 of the supplementary materials.
• Fig_GWAS: Produce Figure 7, located in the Data Application section of the main text. 
The internal comments within each script will provide further guidance and clarification as needed.
